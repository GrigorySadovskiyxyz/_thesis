  title = {Measuring {{Technological Distance}} for {{Patent Mapping}}},
  abstract = {Recent works in the information science literature have presented cases of using patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of technology fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence analysis and innovation decision making. Constructing such a patent network requires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents in the patent classification systems. Despite the existence of various distance measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology network maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of such technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps. Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and International Patent Classification system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which quantify interfield knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized co-reference and inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.},

Which techniques are used for TF? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques / how do we evaluate their quality? Do we need different TF techniques for different purposes/technologies? We also present a brief analysis of how TF is used in practice. We analyze how corporate decisions, such as investing millions of dollars to a new technology like solar energy, are being made and we explore if funding allocation decisions are based on “objective, repeatable, and quantifiable ” decision parameters. Throughout the analysis, we compare the bibliometric and semantic-enabled approach of the MIT/MIST Collaborative research project “Technological Forecasting using Data Mining and Semantics ” (TFDMS) with the existing studies / practices of TF and where TFDMS fits in and how it will contribute to the general TF field. 1.},

  abstract = {[In the 1980s, a dramatic change in the competitive structure of the machine tool industry through the development and implementation of CNC-technology occurred. For the individual company, the timely anticipation and forecast of these technological challenges has been of vital importance in order to incorporate these technological changes into its strategic planning process. This paper assesses the suitability of patent data for forecasting technological developments, based on the experience in the case of CNC-technology. Following a general description of the technological life cycle concept and the discussion of possible benefits of patent data as a technological forecasting tool, actual patenting activity in CNC-technology is analysed. It is found that the diffusion of CNC-technology can be appropriately described by means of patent data. Different development stages in the life cycle of CNC-technology can be distinguished, where for each stage strategic R\&D investment decisions can be derived. Analysing the impact of CNC-technology on the trade pattern between Japan and Germany clearly reveals that patenting activity causes subsequent and immediate market changes. The strong Japanese patent position in CNC-technology is closely associated with favourable trade changes. Consequently, it is recommended to incorporate the systematic and continuous monitoring of patenting activity into a company's overall competitor monitoring intelligence. Especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, patent data analysis provides a technological forecasting instrument with high potential benefits and relatively low cost.]},

The quality of forecasts would greatly depend on proper selection and application of appropriate techniques. The application demands that the technique used need to be time-, space- and technology-specific. An analysis of the limitations of TF is indicative of the fact that very little effort has been made to select an appropriate technique for a particular technology. Selection of an appropriate technique in a particular situation could affect the accuracy and reliability of the forecast. A methodology is suggested in this paper to match the technique to a technology by mapping both technology and technique characteristics on a common scale. The technique whose profile closely fits the technology profile becomes an obvious choice. This method will help in selection of complementary and appropriate techniques for a technology. Two specific technologies pertaining to Main Battle Tank (MBT) and Information Technology (IT) have been selected to illustrate application of proposed methodology.},

In particular, the price is given by the monthly fee to be paid by the lessee as compensation for using a car over some contract horizon. After contract expiration, lessors are obliged to take back the vehicle, which will then be sold in the used car market. Therefore, lessors require an accurate estimate of cars' residual values to manage the risk inherent to their business and determine profitable prices. We explore the organizational and technical requirements associated with this forecasting task and develop a prediction model that complies with identified application constraints. The model is rigorously tested within an empirical study and compared to established benchmarks. The results obtained in several experiments provide strong evidence for the proposed model being effective in generating accurate predictions of cars' residual values and efficient in requiring little user intervention.},

Successful technological, marketing, and organizational innovations result in a sustainable competitive advantage and lead to better financial results. As it stands, the organizational innovation is considered to be a vehicle for technological and market development. It is, in turns, driven by the involvement of employees, which therefore needs to be investigated before innovation can take place. The research objectives are to define the performance of organizations' high involvement innovation (HII) in the construction industry in Russia, to analyze the correlation between HII and HR performances in order to determine the potential of organizational innovation development and promotion of employee involvement in the industry. A behavioral model questionnaire was applied to measure both the performance of organizations' HII and the average value of the construction industry. A HR performance questionnaire was developed to analyze the organizations' HR management efficiency as well as the correlation between HII and HR performances in the industry. The analysis of the collected data shows that the industry gets the 3rd position in the HII score, where HII is goal oriented. The research revealed that the HII performance depends directly on how efficient a company's HR management is, while the potential of introducing HII within the studied area is not taken full advantage of. The findings give us reasons to believe that low-level capabilities could be improved to move the firms studied to the 5th position, demonstrating a strong innovation capability with HII being the dominant culture.},

  abstract = {Fleet-based industrial data symbiosis focused on producing innovative technological solutions that enable improved integration, harmonization, sharing, and standardization of fleet life-cycle data. A fleet was defined as a set of similar or nearly similar units, consisting of, for example, equipment and machinery, people, customers, or platforms. Fleet management was viewed as including the management of installed bases, that is, the globally supplied units of an equipment manufacturer. Technical and economic life-cycle data is usually fragmented in value ecosystems around the fleet, and its full potential is not often utilized. The key to novel service delivery is to process and upgrade the accumulated data into knowledge that can be used in decision-making and ecosystem-level cooperation. Two major outcomes were delivered: a data to business knowledge (D2BK) model was constructed to turn fleet-based life-cycle data into business intelligence, and an intelligent fleet management platform concept (FPC) for the future with the industrial internet was created. Models for intelligent maintenance and life-cycle solutions to optimize the fleet life-cycle and operations were presented. Figure 36 describes the research setting and ecosystem context of the fleet-based industrial data symbiosis research. The results of the project improve companies' understanding of fleet life-cycle data, its standardization, its business potential, and the dynamics of the value ecosystems operating around fleets. When fleet life-cycle operations can be optimized, the impact is significant and includes improved efficiency, productivity, safety, and quality in a more cost-efficient way. The D2BK model includes: a) various sources of fleet life-cycle data, b) short-and long-term decision-making situations in fleet management , c) extended service concepts as a source of customer value, and d) the value of shared information in the ecosystem. The model brings new insight into improving fleet management practices and designing new fleet-based services. The case companies developed specific tools, processes, and service concepts for their own businesses, including structured and automated processes for gathering fleet data, potential},

The paper describes the pioneering research being undertaken to update and advance this phenomenal piece of work. Evolution of TRIZ is involving a renewed programme of analysis of the global patent database – taking into account the shifting emphasis of the intellectual property database towards markedly increased numbers of electrical and software based inventions – in order to improve the Contradiction Matrix, trends of evolution and other tools. The paper also describes improvements to an overriding systematic creativity philosophy being generated by integration of TRIZ with other problem definition and solution methods like QFD, DFMA, Value Engineering, Robust Design, Theory of Constraints, as well as less-structured approaches like those found in the work of Edward De Bono, NLP and mindmapping.},

The most significant features of the proposed system are its global covering, high accuracy of positioning, easy operation by the user at any location, and easy energy management. In this study, I have designed and fabricated more than 50 Rad100 trackers and also programmed a web-based PayaRadyab software in which their performance and accuracy have been confirmed by the practical results in different conditions.},

The method used was a literature review, and later, an analysis of the concepts used by the studies surveyed, seeking points of convergence and divergence. As a result we propose a clarification in order to aid understanding of the terms, setting a benchmark for future research.

  abstract = {This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the private value of patents and R\&D in European firms during the period 1991-2004. We explore the relationship between firm's stock market value, patents, and "quality"-weighted patents issued by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We find that Tobin's q is positively and significantly associated with R\&D and patent stocks, but that only those patents taken out in both patent offices or at the USPTO alone seem to be valued. Either forward citations or a composite quality indicator based on forward citations, family size and the number of technical fields covered by the patent are modestly informative for value. Software patents account for a rising share of total patents in the USPTO and EPO. Moreover, some scholars of innovation and intellectual property rights argue that software and business methods patents on average are of poor quality and that these patents are applied for merely to build portfolios rather than for protection of real inventions. We found that such patents are considerably more valuable than ordinary patents, especially if they are taken out in the U.S. However their quality indicators are no more valuable than those of other patents, suggesting that their primary purpose may be to increase the size of the patent portfolio.},

An intellectual property right (IPR) is a legally codified right created and used to assign ownership to intellectual resources such as knowledge, technologies, brand names, and other types of intellectual creations. The family of IPRs includes patent rights, copyrights, design rights, trademark rights, trade secret rights, and some other types of ancillary rights. IPRs are granted mainly to incentivize investments in creation and commercialization of new intellectual resources in order to improve the provision of innovations of various kinds to the benefit of consumers and society in general. However, IPRs have received critique not only for creating monopoly distortions but more recently also for counteracting innovativeness due to their increasingly dispersed exclusionary function. Nevertheless various IPR laws have become adopted more or less worldwide.},

In this paper, we develop a new benchmarking methodology that overcomes limitations of existing approaches and offers a more accurate assessment of a firm’s patent portfolio vis-à-vis its competitors. Firms are ranked according to the Patent Asset Index, which is derived from a set of newly developed patent indicators. These indicators are empirically validated and reflect more accurately the value of patents. We apply the new benchmarking method in the global chemical industry and contrast our findings with those of other existing patent portfolio rankings.},

Therefore, this study aims to identify key factors for introducing related systems to the case company. By using DEMATEL and ANP, we can find not only key factors but also causes and effects among key factors. The results showed that support from executives was the most important criterion but it has the worst performance among key factors. It is found that adequate annual budget planning, enhancement of user intention, and collaboration with consultants with high specialty could be helpful to enhance the faith of top executives for successfully introducing the systems to the case company.},

Business high-level features are decomposed into smaller functional units, resulting in a hierarchical structure of business functions of different granularity. At the bottom of the functional decomposition hierarchy, there are so-called primitive functions which are in fact managing processes. The specifications of the interactions between the systems participants are use case diagrams. The specification of business processes has been realized through BPMN diagrams (choreographies and collaboration diagrams). An automated solution improves the quality of operations and coordinates all participants in this business system.

  abstract = {The aim of work package 2 (WP2) of the Innosec project was to provide structured information on various new and promising innovation concepts and practices as a basis for the development of the Innosec innovation model within work package 3.
Therefore, within WP2 innovation models and specific innovation methods were identified through reviews of scientific literature and European Projects. The identified innovation approaches were then described, structured, assessed, and the most promising for the security sector were selected.
Based on the suggestion of the model of innovation management in security organisations of work package 1 (WP1) (see D1.2 Empirical Study of innovation management practices of users in the security sector) the building blocks of innovation management were introduced and described.
Finally, a typology of advanced innovation management models was developed, structuring the selected innovation approaches and methods with regards to their ability to support the innovation process within the various building blocks of the Innosec innovation model.
Additionally, an empirical analysis of current innovation practices in non-security sectors was performed. Therefore, innovation practices of fourteen organisations from non-security sectors within Europe were studied through interviews and desktop research. As guiding principles for innovation management from an empirical point of view, lessons learned from each of these case-studies were described.
The main results of the work package were discussed at a validation workshop where also the requirements of the Innosec model were further developed.},

The purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic patent summarization method for accurate knowledge abstraction and effective R\&D knowledge management., – This paper develops an integrated approach for automatic patent summary generation combining the concepts of key phrase recognition and significant information density. Significant information density is defined based on the domain‐specific key concepts/phrases, relevant phrases, title phrases, indicator phrases and topic sentences of a given patent document., – The document compression ratio and the knowledge retention ratio are used to measure both quantitative and qualitative outcomes of the new summarization methodology. Both measurements indicate the significant benefits and superior results of the method., – In order to implement the methodology with practical success, the accurate and efficient pre‐processing of identifying key concepts and relevant phrases of patent documents is required. The approach relies on a powerful text‐mining engine as the pre‐process module for key phrase extraction., – The methodology helps R\&D companies consistently and automatically process, extract and summarize the core knowledge of related patent documents. This enabling technology is critical to R\&D companies when they are competing to create new technologies and products for short life cycle marketplaces., – This research addresses a new perspective in R\&D knowledge management, particularly in solving the knowledge‐overloading issue. The methodology helps R\&D collaborative teams consistently to summarize the core knowledge of patent documents with efficiency. Efficient R\&D knowledge management helps the firm to take advantage of IP positioning while avoiding patent conflict and infringement.},

An Automatic Patent Classification (APC) system has been developed based on text mining techniques to facilitate the patent retrieval process. The data was collected from Global Patent Index (GPI) database and interviews were conducted to involve expert's opinion. Technology forecasting method utilized the collected patent data to define the technological life cycles of LEV technology. The growth curves estimates steady growth in LEV technologies including hybrid and battery electronic vehicles, and apparently reaching to saturation point in few decades is inevitable. Plus, patenting activity of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology was experiencing the infancy period so far, and further it is anticipated to reach higher growth rate in line with other energy alternatives. The proposed method can help patent researchers in terms of retrieving accurate patents based on their technology target. Moreover, the technology forecasting techniques provide an insight to investors assisting them to allocate their resources properly. The results can benefit car industry stakeholders to anticipate the most promising technology areas in an uncertain dynamic market.},

  abstract = {Focus of this research is designing Transportation Management System (TMS) as e-learning media for logistic education. E-learning is the use of Internet technologies to enhance knowledge and performance. E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. E-learning appears to be at least as effective as classical lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing classical training but as a complement to it. TMS are one of many system that will be completed the supply chain. To support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network we can use a web service. By using web service, TMS software can communicated with Supply Chain Management (SCM) software and completed the supply chain. In previous research about logistic problems, still limited to the modul design of SCM application without TMS support. We created this e-learning media by using PHP, SOAP, SQL and HTTP connection protocol. The result of the research is web-based e-learning application to learn about transportation with simulation problems to complete the purpose of supply chain on logistics.

Fokus dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mendesain sebuah e-learning media mengenai Transportation Management System (TMS) sebagai media pembelajaran untuk mempelajari masalah logistik. E-learning adalah penggunaan teknologi internet untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan dan kinerja. E-learning menawarkan kontrol atas konten, urutan pembelajaran, kecepatan pembelajar, waktu pembelajaran, dan media yang digunakan, untuk memenuhi tujuan dari pembelajaran. Dibandingkan dengan metode pengajaran klasik, e-learning memiliki nilai keefektifan yang sama besar dengan metode pengajaran klasik. E-learning bukan merupakan pengganti dari metode pengajaran klasik melainkan merupakan pelengkap dari metode pengajaran klasik. TMS merupakan satu dari beberapa system yang ada dalam kajian rantai pasok. Dengan menggunakan teknologi web service maka sebuah system dapat berkomunikasi dengan sistem yang lain dalam sebuah jaringan. Dengan menggunakan teknologi web service, TMS dapat berkomunikasi dengan software Supply Chain Management (SCM) untuk melengkapi rantai pasok. Dalam penelitian yang sebelumnya pernah dilakukan hanya terbatas pada pembuatan aplikasi SCM tanpa adanya dukungan dari TMS. Pembuatan e-learning untuk TMS ini adalah dengan menggunakan PHP, SOAP, SQL dan HTTP connection protocol. Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah sebuah e-learning berbasis web untuk mempelajari masalah transportasi dengan menggunakan masalah simulasi untuk melengkapi rantai pasok dalam logistik.

  abstract = {Although there have been many studies conducted that deal with technology roadmap structure or roadmapping methods, most existing approaches concentrate on market-driven roadmapping. Moreover, a lot of the research depends on qualitative analysis; thus, less rigorous research has been conducted through quantitative analysis or systematic approaches. Hence, this paper aims to propose a new technology roadmapping approach considering technology life cycle through patent citation analysis, which is a relatively robust method of quantitative analysis. At first, patent data of relevant technologies and citation information are collected. Using these data, a patent citation network that consists of nodes (individual patents) and arcs between nodes (citation links between patents) is developed. Secondly, a stage of a selected technology in the life cycle is investigated by considering the year of patent application and the life cycle of the technology. Thus, the lifetime of a technology is estimated to plan the duration of technology development. In addition, subsequent technologies are grouped as nodes of a super-level technology to show the evolution of the technology for the period. Finally, a technology roadmap is drawn by connecting these technology nodes in a technology layer and estimating the duration of development time. In this paper, solar energy-related technology is chosen in order to illustrate the process of the proposed method. The results of this paper can be regarded as a novel approach to technology-driven roadmapping that effectively utilizes the quantitative patent data.},

However, a few researchers also pointed out that a too close relationship between R\&D personnel and marketing personnel can cause important information to be overlooked, thus reducing NPD success. Our research results, which are based on empirical data and the application of the nonparametric regression method Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, show an even more diverse effect of integrating R\&D and marketing if different performance criteria are considered. Results demonstrate that the effect of integration between R\&D and marketing is nonconstant and nonlinear, a finding that could not be captured with parametric assumptions.

and aligned with business strategies (Lee and Chin, 2012). It is generally acknowledged by
experts in the area that KM strategies must be aligned with the business vision; they must
reflect why knowledge is important; knowledge managers must practise what they preach, and
it must provide channels for discussion and allow for the flow of ideas. The consequesnces of not perceiving are dire and will certainly make impossible to realize the business value of

For these reasons, we suggest a novel approach to forecasting PT using patent analysis. The overall process of the proposed methodology consists of three steps. First, to form technology clusters, we clustered patent documents on the basis of the cooperative patent classiﬁcation (CPC), which represents a more detailed technology classiﬁcation system than the international patent classiﬁcation (IPC). Second, regarding the process of deﬁning technology clusters, we examined the combination of CPCs of each formed clusters. Finally, patent indicators such as forward citations, triadic patent families, and independent claims are analyzed to assess whether the technology clusters are promising. We collected patent data on the wellness care industry from the United States Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce (USPTO) to verify the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {The role of military R\&D in the civilian economy has been a controversial one. With rapid changes in the geopolitical power structure, the debate about the defence technology has assumed a higher level of significance. The defence sector has been a driving force in many new technologies, such as developments in micro-electronics, computers, semiconductors, aviation etc. While one can marvel at the contributions of these technologies on the growth of the civilian economy, one can argue about the effectiveness of defence R\&D in producing and diffusing technology suitable for the civilian sector. This paper investigates the pattern of transfer of technology between defence firms and other organizations. Using eight large defence contractors, Boeing, General Dynamics, Grumman, Lockheed, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon and United Technologies, as sample, we have analysed their patents. We have been particularly interested in the pattern of citations. By using patents as the 'tracer' in the technology interaction, we have been able to characterize the pattern, nature and effectiveness of the technology interactions between the defence and non-defence sectors. In the exchange of technological information between a firm and other organizations, we have defined technology input to a firm X as the citations of patents made by firm X. Similarly, technology output of firm X is defined as the number of citations received by its patents from other patents of other organizations. Once we know the identity of the organizations, we can observe the technology exchange between the defence and the non-defence sectors, between the US defence firms and foreign firms. The intensity and efficiency of transfer of technology are computed from these data.},

We studied the technological lifecycles of these technologies in terms of sci- entific discoveries and inventions as well as product innovations. Results indicate that over the years inventions related to these technologies have simultaneously become less radical and less valuable. Furthermore, our analysis shows that these biotechnologies have reached a stage of technological limit or saturation, which may be followed by an innovation cliff.

  abstract = {Research on the management of innovation has been highly fragmented, and to a large extent non-cumulative. Much of the research has been conducted within three separate disciplines, with relatively little overlap or interaction: the management of research and development or technology; new product development and marketing; and organisational development and change. In this paper, we identify a number of emergent themes which have the potential to integrate these diverse streams of research, and result in a more comprehensive model of the innovation process: complexity, networks and learning. We argue that the innovation process is inherently complex, and therefore we need better characterisations of the technological, market and organisational contingencies which affect the opportunity for innovation. With growing complexity, the focus shifts from competencies based on internal assets such as R\&D activities and intellectual property, to the position of a firm within an innovation network and competencies based on its relationships with other organisations. Finally, too much research has been pre-occupied with how firms develop and exploit narrow competencies based on prior experience, rather than how firms acquire new competencies. A focus on organisational learning may provide a richer explanation of the organisational factors which affect the acquisition of new technological and market knowledge.},

  abstract = {Innovation is often described in terms of changes in what a firm offers the world (product/service innovation) and the ways it creates and delivers those offerings (process innovation). Arguably this definition is insufficient since it does not take into account two other areas where innovation is possible-market position and business models. Market position relates to the situation where an established product/service produced by an established process is introduced to a new context; here the innovation management challenge is concerned with issues like adoption behaviour and technology transfer. Business model innovation relates to the situation in which a reframing of the current product/service, process and market context results in seeing new challenges and opportunities and letting go of others. Each of these poses challenges for the ways in which innovation is organised and managed—what we term innovation management capability. The paper explores some of these challenges and also looks at the additional issues raised by discontinuous innovation, moving beyond the steady state conditions of ‘doing what we do but better’ to a new set of conditions in which ‘doing different things in different ways’ becomes the norm.},

  abstract = {Research and Development is an intricate process involving a host of challenging technological frontiers. This paper presents a practical tool to help R\&D personnel satisfy the needs of customers by a systematic evaluation of R\&D performance. To establish a sound methodology for R\&D performance evaluation, we employ the object-process analysis (OPA) part of the object–process methodology. Using OPA, we gradually expose the constituents of the R\&D system, its environment and the interaction between them. Through this systematic top-down refinement, we provide a comprehensive generic view of the R\&D domain. The framework presented in the paper allows the user to describe, order, and inter-relate the issues that R\&D managers should consider when managing, evaluating and planning R\&D. As the approach addresses structure and behaviour in a unified, integrated manner, the analysis provides insights into both the static and dynamic aspects of the R\&D domain and establishes a solid basis for its enterprise modeling.},

  abstract = {The environmental impact has been a critical issue in supply chain network research. Handling it efficiently will help the firm reduce pollution and save cost. In order to improve the environmental effect on this supply chain network, recovery activity becomes a significant part in the reverse logistics network, due to complexity and heterogeneity. In a reverse logistics network, there are many decision problems to be taken into consideration such as facility location, capacity allocation, production planning and vehicle routing. Each of these problems can be categorized into three types of decision planning: strategic, tactical or operational, based on the time planning horizon. In this paper, we review the literature of supply chain network in an effort to achieve green through implementing reverse logistic practices, and classify the defined problems by the group of decision planning. In general, most of the literatures are focused on the strategic and tactical decision planning, only a few are operational-based. The objective of this paper is to analyze the decision planning being done in this area of research and provide future insights on how to design the reverse logistics network with different decision planning which will reflect the real life scenario.},

Two modeling algorithms based on the patent grant/publish ratio as well as one long-term modeling algorithm based on the average publish-to-grant lag, were developed accordingly. The relationships between patent grants and published patent applications were constructed through two case studies on Magnetic Random Access Memory and Organic Light-Emitting Diode technologies and corresponding forecasts were then conducted. Comparing to the traditional time-series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method, the predicting power of the modeling algorithms based on the patent grant/publish ratio was satisfactory. On the other hand, the modeling algorithm based on the characteristic of average publish-to-grant lag has shown superior predicting power. Results from these two applications help us to validate the proposed methods and appropriate tools for forecasting the patent grants.},

The analysis of the data was based, not on the standard cross-impact matrix approach to handling quantifiable information within Delphi surveys, but on a novel alternative method which allows the data to be expressed in terms of probabilities (the basic equations are probability statements using binomial probabilities and Bayes's formula) and takes into account, in a well-founded way, different levels of respondents' expertise. The method owes something to the work of D. V. Lindley. To the knowledge of the authors of this paper, and despite its suitability for the purpose, Lindley's approach to quantifying weighted expert opinions has never before been used in conjunction with a Delphi survey. The analysis for an example question from the questionnaire used in the survey is given in detail, and the results of four other questions are discussed.},
